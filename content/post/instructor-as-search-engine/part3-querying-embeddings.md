"Mean pooling" is a method of combining multiple embeddings into a single embedding. It's done by taking the mean (average) of each dimension of the embeddings. This is useful for combining multiple embeddings into a single embedding, such as when you want to combine the embeddings of all reviews for a game into a single embedding representing the game.
