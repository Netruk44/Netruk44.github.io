This is the third part in a series that covers how I created a custom search engine for Steam games using embeddings.

At this point, we have a database of embeddings for Steam game descriptions and reviews. We now need to do a bit of a 'spot check' to make sure that querying the embeddings with a game description actually works, and works well enough to be useful.

## How to Query the Embeddings?

The first challenge is figuring out the implementation details of actually searching through the database. We want some kind of measure of 'closeness' between two embeddings, so that we can find the closest match for any given query. The method I've chosen to use here is called cosine similarity.

Google has some [educational material](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/similarity/measuring-similarity) discussing some alternatives you can use, but I was most familiar with cosine similarity, so I went with that. It's easy enough to swap out for something else later if I want to.

### Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity essentially measures the 'angle' between two vectors, or embeddings. The closer the angle is to 0, the more similar the two vectors are. The resulting value is between -1 and 1, with 1 being the most similar.

This isn't a math blog, so I won't go into the details of how it works, but you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). All that you really need to know is that you can use it to measure the similarity between two embeddings.

If you're using PyTorch, you can use the `torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity` function to calculate the cosine similarity between two tensors. You can also implement it yourself pretty easily in numpy:

```python
import numpy as np

def cosine_similarity(a: List[float], b: List[float]) -> float:
    return np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))
```

Now all we have to do is take in a query, convert it to an embedding, then calculate the cosine similarity between that embedding and every other embedding in the database.

{{<collapse summary="Won't the O(N) approach to searching be too slow to be usable?">}}
> For large numbers of embeddings, yes. But during my development, searching through 50,000 embeddings took 3 seconds in total. It's not ideal, but certainly isn't slow enough to worry about for now.
>
> Later on in this post I'll discuss creating an index for the embeddings that will make searching much faster.
{{</collapse>}}

But Steam reviews can be a little noisy as far as data goes. It's not uncommon for meme/joke reviews that don't discuss much of the actual game to be the top review for a given game. It's tempting to try and filter those kinds of reviews out, but I think there's an easier solution.

An individual review can highlight some unique aspects of a game while leaving other information out. Instead of looking at reviews individually, how can we combine all of the reviews for a game into a single embedding that might better represent the game as a whole?

### Mean Pooling

Mean pooling is a fancy name for creating a new embedding where each dimension is the mean (average) of the corresponding dimension of all of the embeddings you're combining. It's what I would think of as 'getting the average' of a bunch of embeddings.

In terms of Python code, it's pretty simple:

```python
import numpy as np

def mean_pooling(embeddings: List[List[float]]) -> List[float]:
    # Option 1
    return np.mean(embeddings, axis=0)

    # Option 2
    return np.sum(embeddings, axis=0) / len(embeddings)
```

Surprisingly, this does pretty much what you'd expect it to. It takes the 'meaning' of all the embeddings and combines them into a single embedding that represents the whole. You can weight the embeddings differently if you want, too. But in our case since we can't know which review is more important than another, we'll just use the mean.

## Indexing the Embeddings

At this point in development, my database is only populated with the embeddings for ~10,000 game descriptions and reviews. Doing a O(N) search through the whole thing took just 3 seconds, which was fast enough for me to not worry about making searching faster.

However, once the database is fully populated that will no longer be the case. So how do you search through... `150,000 games * (1 game description embedding + 45 reviews on average per game) = 6,900,000` embeddings without looking at each one individually?

### FAISS

[FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), or "Facebook AI Similarity Search", is a library that can be used to create indexes for embeddings. It's designed to be used with embeddings generated by neural networks, which just so happens to be exactly what we're using.

The tutorial I followed to learn how to use FAISS was the Pinecone tutorial [Introduction to Facebook AI Similarity Search (Faiss)](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/faiss-tutorial/). It builds knowledge from the ground up in an intuitive way, and I highly recommend it if you're interested in learning more about how searching can be done quickly.

As of the time of writing, I haven't yet added the index to my project, but I will be doing so soon. I suspect it will be pretty straightforward. If I have any additional thoughts on it, I'll add them here.

## Spot Check

With the implementation finally complete, I was able to check the results for the first time. I was a little disappointed, but not surprised, to find that the results were not amazing. Let's take a look at some examples.

Looking at the top results, things seem to at least match up pretty well. They're at least idle games. But starting about halfway down the list of results, things start to get a little weird. We take a slight detour into turn based roguelikes before another idle game, and wrapping up with some strategy games.

At this point, it's clear there's at least some promise here. But it's hard to tell if the poor results are a result of the model, the implementation, or the lack of data in the dataset. Let's try some more queries.

The results could be better here, too. There's lots of issues with the results. Many of these games, including the top result, aren't first person. Some of them aren't 3D. But at least they all have a relaxing atmosphere and seem to be exploration focused.

Again, many issues with this list. First, a positive. They're at least all related to shooting things üòä. However many of these games aren't first person, and not many of them have any form of unique abilities.

A separate issue is that a fair number of these games feel very...low-effort. I don't want to be too harsh, but some of these appear to be just simple asset flips. I wonder if it might be because the prompt here used very common marketing terms like "action-packed" and "fast-paced", so the model returned very generic-appearing games. Either way, I'm not sure if the bad results are because Steam is just full of generic games, or if the model could be doing something better.


## Conclusion

So, how did it go? Well, I think it suffices to say that the results could be better. But on the bright side, throughout writing this blog series I've been able to identify a few areas where I think I can improve the results.

The results aren't completely useless, though. I've shown this to a couple people, and while they agree the results aren't amazing, they were also able to find some niche games they hadn't heard of before and were interested in. So I think there's at least some promise here.

Enough promise, at least, that I wanted to put it on the internet and write a blog series about it üòä. Even if things don't work great here, maybe someone else can learn something and make a better next version.

So, now that we have something that works (vaguely), the next step is to show someone else and get some feedback. These days, that means making a website. But we aren't going to have the user's browser do the search through the database, so that means we're going to need to create an API that can be used to query the database.
