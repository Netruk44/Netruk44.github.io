Physics Playground is a simple app for the Vision Pro. It's a physics sandbox where you can create objects and interact with them in your physical environment. Using Apple's RealityKit, the objects you create can collide with each other and the real world.

## Description

## Why?
The app was intended as a way for me to learn more about developing for Apple platforms.

Originally, I intended to put this app into the App Store, however Apple has blocked my registration for a developer account, and their support has been unresponsive. As such, I have no way to distribute the app. I don't see much reason to continue learning how to develop for the Apple ecosystem if I can't distribute my work, so I've put this project on hold.

Instead, I may write up a tutorial on how to make your own physics sandbox app using my code as an example at some point in the future.
