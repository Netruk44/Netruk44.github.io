A horror video game concept made in the Godot engine. Try to navigate rooms and solve puzzles while being pursued by a statue that can only move when you aren't looking at it.

## Why?
From the *Weeping Angel Effect in Godot Engine* blog post:
> One of the things I normally do when messing around with a game engine is try to recreate one aspect of a game I helped make in college, [Stonewick Manor](https://old.danieltperry.me/stonewick.html).

I figured I might as well release what I've made so far as a small game concept to the public.
