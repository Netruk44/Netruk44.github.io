Something Else is a source-level mod that adds machine-generated text to [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/en/), an open-source reimplementation of the game engine from [The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/morrowind).

The name comes from the button added to the dialogue window that allows you to enter a custom line of dialogue to speak to the NPC.

* **Status**: Active Development
* **State** *(As of 2023-03-30)*: Very early development, not fully functional.
* **Download**: Not currently easily installable. See [installation instructions](https://github.com/Netruk44/ml-interface/blob/main/doc/openmw-install.md) for detailed instructions. 

## Description
The starting point for "Something Else" is as a conversation mod for Morrowind. You enter in a custom line of text you would like to say to the NPC, and a machine-generated response is created for you. Wouldn't it be nice if you could say something outside of a small list of predefined in-game topics? The goal is to have a mod that allows you to do just that.

The mod is intended to have settings so that you can choose to either run the text generation on the local machine, or use an API like OpenAI's to generate the text remotely.

I have plans to experiment with training a number of small text models (such as [Google's t5-small](https://huggingface.co/t5-small)) for different specific tasks that should be able to run on CPU-only within a relatively short amount of time (hopefully under 5 seconds). The idea is that a number of smaller models trained for specific tasks will be able to run on general hardware, as opposed to a single large model like GPT or LLaMA which requires a lot of GPU power.

> And, (in the case of LLaMA) it would also be nice if I could redistribute the weights, too ðŸ˜Š

With that in mind, the end goal for the mod is to (eventually) be a little bit more than just AI generated dialogue responses. Backing the mod is a framework that should allow the game to be extended in a few different ways. A few ideas I have in mind are:

* Giving memory to NPCs, so that they can remember things you've told them and bring it up next time you initiate conversation with them.
  * Or maybe they might even seek *you* out next time you're in town.
* Adding dynamically generated quests to the game.
  * Basically Radiant Quests, but hopefully with more variety.
* Add custom escort logic to NPCs.
  * Need to know where that stupid cave is? Ask the quest giver to escort you there.
  * (I will admit to this being a far-fetched idea, though. I don't even know if the engine supports this kind of navigation from NPCs.)
* Actual real-(game-)world reactions to your roleplaying
  * If you're a notorious thief, a shopkeeper might call the guards on you just to keep you out of their store.
  * A trainer may provide you their services for free if you can convince them it'll be worth their time.
  * Instead of just clicking "Taunt", "Bribe" and "Intimidate" buttons, you can roleplay your way through the conversation instead.

*The model mostly just regurgitates the input json.)*
